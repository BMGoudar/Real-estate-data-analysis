# Real-estate-data-analysis
In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and created visualizations using MS Excel to analyze the real estate market trends in Terro's region. Through this analysis, I was able to identify key insights and provide data-driven recommendations to Terro's real estate agency on how to optimize their marketing strategy and increase sales.
